<h2>Constraining Rotation</h2>
<p>In a typical tiling puzzle you can flip, shift, and rotate pieces. Can we change these operations to make interesting new puzzles?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flipping</strong> pieces is often limited by printing a pattern on one side (eg, jigsaw puzzles) or making pieces with rounded or uneven tops that discourage upside-down placement.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting</strong> is core to what makes a tiling puzzle. We could anchor every piece to a location but the result would be a very different experience. Shifting can be constrained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle">sliding puzzles</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Rotation</strong> is locked in sliding tile puzzles, and is gently constrained when all pieces are modified rectangles (jigsaw puzzles).</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to make a puzzle where rotation is locked but where pieces can be freely placed or removed at any time. Here are some ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pieces could fit into a board with asymmetric holes. Pieces would only have 1 possible orientation (no turning).</li>
<li>Pieces could fit into a board with regularly spaced grooves. Pieces could be turned to 2 possible orientations (180º turns)</li>
<li>Pieces could fit into a board with rotationally symmetric holes, where they could be turned to a number of orientations based on the symmetry of the hole.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these schemes restrict pieces to a lattice grid.</p>
<p>I chose to do polyomino pieces (4 orientations) and triangle holes (3 orientations), which locks pieces the way asymmetric holes would, but with a bit more pleasing visual symmetry.</p>
<p>In my current iteration pieces are all rectangular, which means they are overconstrained (pieces can't be turned 180º and placed, but even if they could this wouldn't change the puzzle)</p>
