# {{title}}

The goal of this project was to make a satisfying puzzle where every piece is identical.
 
## Play Style
Assemble 42 identical pieces into an elaborate castle.

This is a puzzle with a specific solution, but the pieces also work well for open ended play.

Best with one to four players.
