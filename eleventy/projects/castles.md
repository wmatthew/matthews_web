# {{title}}

The goal of this project is to make a satisfying puzzle where every piece is identical.

"Satisfying" is hard to pin down and certainly harder to assess than "identical". Here are some examples of puzzles that would not be satisfying:

* Arrange 4 square tiles to form a larger square. (trivial)
* Arrange 10,000 square tiles to form a larger square. (tedious)

 
## Play Style
Assemble 42 identical pieces into an elaborate castle.

This is a puzzle with a specific solution, but the pieces also work well for open ended play.

Best with one to four players.
